Sentinel Atlas

Sentinel Atlas is an open-source OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence) intelligence and mapping platform for collecting, verifying, and visualizing global events in real time.

The platform enables anonymous and authenticated users to submit geo-tagged intelligence reports which are reviewed through a multi-level moderation and escalation workflow before appearing on a public intelligence map. Sentinel Atlas is designed to support journalists, researchers, NGOs, analysts, and the public with transparent, auditable, and verifiable intelligence.

Vision

The goal of Sentinel Atlas is to create a modern, open, and trustworthy intelligence platform that brings together:

Real-time OSINT reporting

Geo-verified global event mapping

Expert moderation and escalation workflows

Subject-matter tagging and review

Transparent revision history

Secure role-based governance

Sentinel Atlas is built around the idea that open intelligence should be:

Verifiable

Auditable

Transparent

Accessible

Secure

Development Philosophy

Sentinel Atlas is an AI-assisted open-source project.

The project is being built using modern AI development tools to design, implement, and review architecture, code, and security models. While the project founder does not come from a traditional software engineering background, Sentinel Atlas is developed with a strong focus on:

Clean architecture

Security best practices

Professional governance models

Scalable system design

Transparent documentation

This approach allows the project to move quickly while maintaining high standards for quality, security, and maintainability.

The goal is not just to build software — but to build a platform that people can trust.
